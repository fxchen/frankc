# Design your personal operating system: habits

The operating system you already use everyday: habits

Automate your habit system


Today, a friend asked me for the one piece of insight on how to create lasting habit change.

In a word, automate it. 

Day to day. I build and design software. Software is explicitly designed, when I write software, I can set individual variables, and when something does not operate as I expect, I can run a debugger and observe system variables as it's running. With enough knowledge and tools, I can trace how and when something happens.

I built and design behavior. These usually manifest in behaviors that I think about, design, build a system, then try out. 

Behavior more often than not, is not explicitly designed, and our brains are hard wired to learn behaviors by watching and observing others. In not being explicitly defined, I can not express how and when and why I learned certain behaviors. How did I learn how to walk? (Different sets of behavior arises in different social situations and can manifest through watching others and behaving similarly.) I cannot stop time, analyze how and why I performed a behavior, and observe all of my state as I follow-through.

This means when you're at the gym, you would talk with others differently than you would at a bar than you would at a coffee shop.

Habits are the behaviors that are cognitively easy, they do not require any extra effort. They become out default. They become our routine. They are groups of behaviors that are defined within certain social contexts.


We hear them in articles like: 
- Buzzfeed have writers discus habits in the context of "here's how to be better" [Humor? Habits 20 somethings should adopt to be better]
- Articles in the NY times would have these articles titled ""
- And in Buzzfeed, they would be "20 ways 20 somethings can be happier growing older"

I want to talk about two rules in starting, failing, iterating, and creating habits through a story in habit design.

I am trying to write regularly for the first time in my life. My life's purpose is to build and create ideas, writing distills and crystalizes the best ones. A few months ago, I started a habit of drawing everyday for 40 minutes to learn how to sketch. I thought, I would just follow that template and be able to complete my writing experiment for the coming month. The first few weeks, I sucked. I found I did not have enough hours in a day to start writing and get to work in time for our daily standup. My semi-daily gym workout also suffered from trying to squeeze in two pre-work habits.

# Time-spanned. Saying I'm going to do something forever is a very very hard way to succeed.
# Feedback and iteration. I was lucky enough to listen to my friend Maha give a talk on how she performs time management. 

In a heart beat it finally made sense. It took me about 20-30 minutes to start writing at a fast pace, I could not as easily find a cadence in less than a two hour block.

For the nerds in our audience:
1) Christopher Alexander (see Pattern Language) might call these Selfconscious or unselfconscious environments.
