# Design your personal operating system: habits

Habits are behaviors you do without thought. Your default. Your routine. *Habits become the operating system you live your life through.* I want to share a slice things I have been a part of. I currently work as a software, software is the language I communicate in. In the past, I spoke as behavior experimenter and designer, mostly as a researcher. While there is overlap in technique, the intersection of design, behavior, and engineering is unique. I stand on the shoulders of many whose work preceeded me, I hope to share as many resources in thinking through these topics as possible.

Most people have trouble recognizing the fact: Anyone can change their habits, their routines. By using simple tools and frameworks, anyone can change even the hardest habits. According to a recent study, only about 88% of those who set resolutions achieve them [1].

Habits are a series of choices that are individual behaviors. A behavior is a combination of time, environment, physical and emotional energy, and self-discipline. BJ Fogg, Stanford professor and godfather of Captology (the study of Computers as Persuasive Technologies), mentions fundamentally three ways to change behavior [2]:

> 1. Have an epiphany 
> 2. Change your environment  (what surrounds you)
> 3. Take baby steps

A few months ago, an incredibly smart friend and I were talking about habits. He lost over a hundred pounds over the past year, which was mindblowingly cool to me. And he wanted to do more. When I started to describe my process, I recognized some subtle framing changes to thinking about habits that combine two interests: developing software and designing behavior.

He asked me this question:

> "Is there a secret to maintaining a new, hard habit?"

I want to share a bit of that conversation with you today.

##Developing software

Day to day. I write code that defines what a user sees and how a user can behave in software. Software is designed and built with a specific purpose in mind. When it does not work, I use the equivalent of Spell Checker to have the ability to 1) stop time in software, 2) observe all of the complexities happening in code, and 3) change values in the system to see if it will allow the system to keep running. I can see how and when problems happen.

The tools we use in software development do not exist in the same way to develop behaviors. This software system runs on a computer. I can stop time, and observe, change, tinker with the system in action. We can take part of this framework in thinking the software of our everyday lives, the behavior.

>Good habits free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action. 
>**William James**

## Developing behavior

Habits are social systems we operate in. The only difference in the sheer complexity of many of our social habits 

Instead, the best way to design behaviors 
I built and design behavior. These usually manifest in behaviors that I think about, design, build a system, then try out. 

This means when you're at the gym, you would talk with others differently than you would at a bar than you would at a coffee shop.

[1] Wiseman, Richard. 88% of 3000 people failed in their resolutions.  http://j.mp/RFd65w *Sitenote*: Many cite this study, but seem to miss out on a specific reference. Culprits: WSJ (http://j.mp/1suuKo4), Wikipedia (http://j.mp/QL8Tg0), Guardian (http://j.mp/T4UcGw), Buffer (http://j.mp/1osvCvV). They seem to cite other news articles or contain no citation, which irks me.

[2] Fogg, BJ. At the time of this writing, over 24,000 have participated. It takes about 3 minutes per day and is a single week. http://tinyhabits.com

I want to talk about two rules in starting, failing, iterating, and creating habits through a story in habit design.

I am trying to write regularly for the first time in my life. My life's purpose is to build and create ideas, writing distills and crystalizes the best ones. A few months ago, I started a habit of drawing everyday for 40 minutes to learn how to sketch. I thought, I would just follow that template and be able to complete my writing experiment for the coming month. The first few weeks, I sucked. I found I did not have enough hours in a day to start writing and get to work in time for our daily standup. My semi-daily gym workout also suffered from trying to squeeze in two pre-work habits.

1. Time-spanned. Saying I'm going to do something forever is a very very hard way to succeed.
2. Feedback and iteration. I was lucky enough to listen to my friend Maha give a talk on how she performs time management. 

In a heart beat it finally made sense. It took me about 20-30 minutes to start writing at a fast pace, I could not as easily find a cadence in less than a two hour block.

Today, a friend asked me for the one piece of insight on how to create lasting habit change.

In a word, automate it.


We hear them in articles like: 
- Buzzfeed have writers discus habits in the context of "here's how to be better" [Humor? Habits 20 somethings should adopt to be better]
- Articles in the NY times would have these articles titled ""
- And in Buzzfeed, they would be "20 ways 20 somethings can be happier growing older"


Behavior more often than not, is not explicitly designed, and our brains are hard wired to learn behaviors by watching and observing others. In not being explicitly defined, I can not express how and when and why I learned certain behaviors. How did I learn how to walk? (Different sets of behavior arises in different social situations and can manifest through watching others and behaving similarly.) I cannot stop time, analyze how and why I performed a behavior, and observe all of my state as I follow-through.
