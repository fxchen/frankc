Hello world
============

This piece of internet real estate is reserved for my thoughts that generate ideas, conversations, and projects.

I build stuff as part of my everyday life. I jot some of what I build in programmed scripts, research notebooks, evernote, simplenote, sketch notebooks, note cards. Some of these things become permanent parts of what I do, some of it gets shared among friends, most of it never gets shown to the world.

I have started more writing than I have finished. I'm writing to you now to change that. I'll be writing to crystalize writing and provide value to people who are into the same things I am.

I believe the best growth happens in spans or seasons. We are best suited to create pursuits in consistent spurts rather than a cold turkey yes or no. 

Me?
----

I have spent part of my life as a researcher. I worked in human-computer interaction and built technologies to help motivated individuals create habits by shaping their environment and their habits.

I currently spend most of my time doing software development. I work with a highly talented team to change the way people use enterprise software at AWS.

I like adventures. Running has brought me to see and to hear and to feel the world in a new way. I have spent my fair share of time swimming in every body of water I can find, going through Vinyasa yoga poses and finding out in what ways I am inflexible, eating as much spicy ethnic cuisine as possible.

I cook a lot, I love iterating on recipes with . And, because I like to eat.
I travel whenever possible. To learn about the world and myself.


Stories
-----

Sharing narratives is a part of the human experience. The individual hearing the narrative uses their unique perspective to create a new and different understanding of the story they hear. Stories allow us to pare down complexity into simple narratives
